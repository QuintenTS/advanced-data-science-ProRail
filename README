cleaned data 23_09.ipynb is the code for cleaning the raw data set.
What it does:
1. It deletes complete empty rows
2. It keeps rows where processtype is not ANNULERING (so deletes Annulering)
3. It keeps reaction type: aangeboden and geen mogelijk
4. It deletes rows without reaction
5. It keeps rows where processtype is not handmatig
6. It keeps rows where processtype is not NSR
7. It keeps rows where processtype is not JAARDIENST
8. It keeps only rows with most recent ordernummer

The cleaned dataset is then saved into a new csv file called "cleaned_dataset.csv"

test_2.ipynb is the code for generating a numeric dataset for machine learning.
What it does:
1. It filters the data by process type, leave only the NIEUW requests
2. It extracts the hours from the earliest departure time column, and remove the rows where this information is missing
3. The hours of a day of the earliest departure time column is then encoded in a cyclical way, so that 0:00 is close to 23:00
4. The reaction by ProRail is mapped into binary numbers. AANGEBODEN: 1, GEEN_AANBIEDING_MOGELIJK: 0
5. The stabling service request information (binary) and time tolerance are copied from the cleaned dataset
6. The days of week of the requests are also encoded in a cyclical way, so that Monday is close to Sunday
7. The origin and destinations are encoded with OneHotEncode

The numeric dataset is saved into a new csv file called "numeric_dataset.csv"
